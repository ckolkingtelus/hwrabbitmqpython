# make sure the recipient queue exists. Creating a queue using queue_declare is idempotent â€’ we can run the command as many times as we like, and only one will be created; we're not yet sure which program was run first (send.py or receive.py), so in such cases it's a good practice to repeat declaring the queue in both programs
channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')
